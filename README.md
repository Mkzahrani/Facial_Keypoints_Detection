# Installation

Processo de instalação :

This notebook was developed in [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org) using [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org) environment. This is not a requirement to run the notebook provided in this repository, however as it was used to develop it therefore it and it is a well known environment among data scientists is provided a quick guide in how to install and set up your environment.



## Anaconda

Go to the [link](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#download) and download the version suited to your platform.

The Installation process is quite simple just follow the assistant that is provided when it is launched the application.

After the installation is done open a terminal and check the version installed using the following code via terminal :

```
$ conda -V

```
Then check for the packages using the following :

```
$ conda list

```
Check for the versions of listed on Requirements sessions and in case that is something out of data except for `Keras` that is not a default package use the following code via terminal.

```
$ conda update anaconda

```
